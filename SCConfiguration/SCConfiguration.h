/**
 This class can read predefined key-value pairs from a plist file called <code>Configuration.plist</code>.

 The config file may contain dictionaries with a provided key and inside every key may be a registry
 entry with the environments used in the application or the config file may contain global
 values which are not environment dependent.

 You have the ability to set certain keys protected or unprotected and you can overwite unprotected keys with a
 provided dictionary too. It's useful for example if you have a local config file but you want to overwite / add
 certain keys from an API.

 The overwrites can be set as persistant so it'll remain between application launches (this is the default behavior)
 or can be set to not persistant so the modification will be lost between application launches.
